Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

Introduction

          The central dogma of molecular biology describes the linear directional transfer of genetic information, particularly the transfer of DNA to RNA to protein. This transfer is highly significant in biological systems as protein is functional in living cells according to Miller et al. (2023),

Key Components Involved

         DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a double-stranded molecule composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine). The two strands are complementary and form a double helix whose main function is the synthesis of protein and regulation of cellular activities according to Spiegel et al. (2020)

            Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is similar to DNA in regards to their nucleotide composition, however, RNA is typically single-stranded and has a shorter nucleotide chain. RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles such as coding and decoding and gene regulation and expression according to the National Human Genome Research Institute (2019)

            Proteins are made up of polypeptide chains that fold into given three-dimensional shapes necessary for their function. According to Sanvictores and Farci (2022), proteins are functional in cells, including catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes), providing structural support, and gene regulation.

Processes Involved

Replication

Replication is the process through which DNA makes a copy of itself. In this process, a double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds in the presence of a helicase enzyme exposing the nitrogenous bases. DNA polymerase enzyme then adds complementary nucleotides to each exposed strand, resulting in the formation of two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand according to Sevier (2020)

Transcription

Transcription is a process in which the genetic information encoded in DNA is transferred to a single-stranded RNA molecule. During this process, the RNA polymerase enzyme binds to the promoter region of a gene which signals the start of synthesis. Complementary RNA nucleotides of RNA are added as the polymerase enzyme moves along the DNA template. Uracil is substituted for Thymine and the process ends when RNA polymerase reaches a terminator sequence releasing a newly formed RNA sequence. This sequence matures to form mRNA.

Translation

Translation is the process through which mRNA synthesizes protein in the cytoplasm. It starts with ribosomes binding to mRNA followed by a supply of specific amino acids from Transfer RNA (tRNA) where their anticodons pair with the mRNA codons. The ribosome facilitate a peptide bond formation between the amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain that sequentially folds into a functional protein. Translation continues until a stop codon is reached, signaling the completion of the protein synthesis.

Reverse Transcription

According to Aiken and Rousso (2021), the basic flow of genetic information can sometimes be non-linear and in this case, Reverse Transcription occurs. In certain viruses, like retroviruses such as HIV, RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA using the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The integration of the newly synthesized DNA into the host genome, allows the virus to replicate freely within the host cells.****

 Gene Regulation

Gene regulation is the process by which cells control the expression of their genes, enabling them to respond to environmental changes and differentiate into various cell types. Regulation occurs at multiple levels, including transcriptional control, post-transcriptional control, translational control, and post-translational control.

Mutation and Errors

Mutations and errors often occur during DNA replication, transcription, or translation, potentially leading to significant changes in the genetic code or the structure of proteins according to Clancy (2019). Some mutations have significant effects, such as altering protein function or leading to diseases like cancer. These mutations drive evolution by introducing genetic diversity.


Conclusion

In summary, the central dogma explains the genetic flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein. However, the basic flow of information is non-linear, with exceptions like reverse transcription making the process complex.
