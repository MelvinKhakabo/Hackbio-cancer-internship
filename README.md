This repo contains an essay on the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology.

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the linear directional transfer of genetic information, 
particularly the transfer of DNA to RNA to protein. This transfer is highly significant in biological systems as protein is functional in living cells.

In summary, the central dogma explains the genetic flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein. However, the basic flow of information is non-linear, 
with exceptions like reverse transcription making the process complex.
